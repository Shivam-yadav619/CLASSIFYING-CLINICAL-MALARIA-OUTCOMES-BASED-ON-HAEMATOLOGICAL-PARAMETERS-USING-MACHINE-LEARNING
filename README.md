# CLASSIFYING-CLINICAL-MALARIA-OUTCOMES-BASED-ON-HAEMATOLOGICAL-PARAMETERS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Accurately diagnosing malaria, particularly differentiating uncomplicated malaria (UM), severe malaria (SM), and non-malarial infections (nMI), poses a significant challenge due to overlapping symptoms. This machine learning project addresses the diagnostic challenge, especially in cases where low parasitaemia or Pfhrp2/3 gene deletions reduce the reliability of traditional rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Our model, trained on a dataset of over 2,700 patient records, achieved an accuracy of 89% by leveraging hematological data, providing a more reliable and efficient tool for malaria diagnosis. The project utilizes tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization, and employs the Random Forest Classifier along with various model evaluation methods (precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix). Additionally, the train-test split method was used to ensure accurate model validation.
